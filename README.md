- Development git@git.wpengine.com:acelpahealth.git
- Github git@github.com:PepperGroup/acelpa.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Site forms built with HubSpot 
- Site uses the Web Accessibility by accessiBe plugin to power the front end accessiBe widget 
- Locations page uses Storepoint map that uses websites@peppergroup.com for login to Client's Google Account for payment; client Storepoint credentials available in Keeper 

**Recurring Tasks**
- Monthly Storepoint receipts comes to websites@peppergroup.com for charges related to the Locations page (map feature) https://acelpahealth.com/locations/  Receipts should be forwarded to lynn@peppergroup.com and cc'ed to eliza@peppergroup.com with the note:

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Optional-but-recommended schema fields missing from blog posts: <br>
<img src="./img/acelpa-posts.png">

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- Footer Privacy Policy links are outbound links to PDFs hosted on HubSpot
- Acelpa is part of a wider pharmacy acquisition network, similar to PG's private equity clients. The acelpahealth.com site was an exception for this client, in that PG created a site from the ground up rather than integrated brand style into an acquisition website (cf https://hisprx.com).

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- A <u>wide</u> range of forms are used on the site: 
    - FormStack script embed <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/ (footer) 
    - FormStack iframe embeds <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/brand-partners/
    - Outbound links to FormStack forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/give-books/ "Start a Book Drive" > https://formstack.io/547E9 
    - Classy/GoFundMe donation embeds <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/donate/ 
    - Outbound links to Classy/GoFundMe pages <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/honorary-memorial-gifts/ "Digital Book Drive Fundraiser" > https://give.berniesbookbank.org/campaign/create-a-fundraising-page/c631618 
    - Embedded Cervis signup forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/individual-volunteering/ 
    - Outbound links to Cervis signup forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/volunteer/ "Volunteer as a Group" > https://berniesbookbank.cervistech.com/acts/console.php?console_id=0042&console_type=group 
    - Outbound links to Microsoft forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/give-books/ "Need a Receipt" > https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Z7ESCVhNqUqo1KN5wRzJr-yxVFZeQNFMkKGbvWFJc4pUN1hXRkFYNjRSSDRaSkRURkhYSk1VQVFWUS4u 
- Resulting action upon successful form submission varies widely; some forms redirect to https://www.berniesbookbank.org/thank-you, some forms open in a modal window that then closes, some forms display a modal thank you message, &c. 
- Build includes custom formatting buttons for the WordPress text editor (see `./assets/jas/tiny-mce.js`). Custom formatting buttons: 
    - Screen Reader Only Text
    - highlight (thin font used in header)
    - cite (for Testimonials speaker attribution) 
    - heading (`<h1>` styling as defined in this build)
    - subhead (`<h2>` styling as defined in this build)
    - subsubhead (`<h3>` styling as defined in this build)
    - button (style a link to look like a button)
- Uses a Storepoint embedded map connect to client's Google Cloud Account; Storepoint credentials for websites@peppergroup.com in Keeper 
- Uses an &ldquo;Opt Out&rdquo; cookie notice powered by CookieYes
- Rotating image in desktop pre-footer section powered by a custom-built module using Advanced Custom Fields Pre-Footer Images repeater field and `/inc/random-images.php`

**Recurring Tasks**
- Ongoing monthly site maintenance

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- FormStack iframe embeds include hard-coded max-height; if client adds or removes fields from within their FormStack interface, the form's max-height should be adjusted within the **Code** block 
![iframe with max-height](./img/bernies-hardcoded-maxheight.png)
- Client's Formstack default settings include placeholder spaces in the Firstname and Lastname fields, which can then become bad data in client's CRM (a hard-coded space); for ease and speed of development, form fields are cleared with JavaScript after the form loads, cf `./assets/jas/clear-formstack-names.js` 
- Internal anchor links to FAQ sections were prone to "not scroll to anchor." As a workaround, monstrous JavaScript in the theme waits for page load and ensures subsequent smooth scroll to FAQ sections: `./assets/forced-anchors.js` 
- Site build uses Schema markup in template files to optimize search surfacing Events and Blog Posts
- Events requre manual updates in ACF for display 
- Schema for Events included only on Chapter pages to avoid dealing with the complexity of events with multiple locations and dates 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/chicagoland/ 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/greater-milwaukee/ 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/florida-suncoast/ 
- Events schema logic should be updated to not appear if critical fields are not available (e.g. `location`, `startDate`) 
- Events schema implementation does not include optional-but-recommended fields: 

![Bernie's Book Lovers' Lunch schema results](./img/bernies-schema.png) 

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- Forms are under strict client control; during development, client allowed PG developer access via temporary credentials and screenshare as an acceptable workaround. 
- Site is on `www` subdomain; in the first months after development some users (including client) came to an error page when trying to access the site on the bare domain. In December 2025 client IT added a redirect in client DNS settings which resolved the observed DNS issue.

- Production: git@git.wpengine.com:carowpackaging.git
- Staging: git@git.wpengine.com:carowpackagstg.git
- Github: git@github.com:PepperGroup/carow2024.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Uses Essential Grid for blog posts and products 
- Uses Google reCAPTCHA v2 invisible to secure the site https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/site/707930137
- Forms built with Gravity Forms and secured with reCAPTCHA vw

**Recurring Tasks**
- Site receives monthly maintenance from PG

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Resource sorting via Essential Grid is unfortunately limited to a blanket AND or OR Boolean logic, which makes for confusing UI. https://carowpackaging.com/resources/ 
- At some browser heights, top frame cuts off Google reCAPTCHA badge in the lower right corner; screenshot below from Chrome on a retina Mac, 1692 pixels high: 

![Google reCAPTCHA badge cut off on some desktop viewports](./img/carow-recaptcha-badge-cut-off.png)

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- This particular Enfold child build seems particularly vulnerable to not generating CSS on-the-fly; frequently after monthly updates, homepage content does not wrap properly on desktop. CSS consistently properly regenerates upon saving the homepage from the Page Edit screen. 



## CSPRx 

<img src="./img/csprx-home.png" style="margin-bottom: 1.414rem;">

**URL:** https://csprx.com/ 

**Development URL:** https://californiaspe2.wpenginepowered.com/

**History + Status:** Inherited build using Divi and assorted Divi add-ons. Significant PG development efforts toward improving accessibility and UI in October 2025.

**Repositories**
- Production git@git.wpengine.com:californiaspe1.git
- Development git@git.wpengine.com:californiasp3.git
- Github git@github.com:PepperGroup/csprx.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Uses Elementor theme, Elementor Pro plugin, and The Plus Addons for Elementor.
- Uses Gravity Forms 
- accessiBe widget added in the WordPress back end under **Custom CSS & JS > accessibe** with additional CSS customzation in `customify-child/header.php` 
- OneTrust cookie widget and additional CSS customization added in `customify-child/header.php` 

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Site is a highly-customized inherited build

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- Client has a history of running third-party tech reports (Screaming Frog report run by Taco, accessiBe accessibility reports) that are then sent to PG as a punchlist for site updates 
- Site has a standalone Envoy portal airgapped from the WordPress build, used for sensitive individual patient and provider logins: https://portal.csprx.com/login/ 
- Edit Footer under **Elementor > Editor > Templates > Footer Live** - <a href="https://csprx.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=13&action=elementor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct link</a>


## DeliverHealth

**Landing Page URL:** https://deliverhealth.com/esone-instanote/ 

**Main Site URL:** https://ai.deliverhealth.com/ 

**Legacy Site URL:** https://staging-htech.deliverhealth.com/

**History + Status:** In July 2024 PG developed a handful of landing pages on client's WordPress site using Gravity Forms and Calendly. In November 2025 Client transitioned nearly all site content to an AI-generated build on Lovable.  

**Hosting:** Lovable site hosted on [??]; Legacy WordPress site hosted on SiteGround and managed by Hagadonetech

**Repositories**
- Github git@github.com:PepperGroup/deliverhealth.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- WordPress landing pages use Calendly links
- WordPress forms built with WP Forms secured with reCAPTCHA v3 https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/site/729642121 
- Forms additionally secured with Antideo Email Validator, used in the build to bar disposible emails
- Form notifications passed to client via Resend - client has access

**Recurring Tasks**
- N/A

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- 

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- If working on the Lovable site, beware applying AI-suggested security updates; Lovable's suggested and optional security updates have had unintended negative consequences throughout the build

**Repositories**
- Production
- Staging
- Github

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- 

**Recurring Tasks**
- Receives monthly site maintenace. 

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Services hotspot module should be updated to dismiss pop-ups with keyboard Escape key https://enviroserve.com/services/
- This site, alone among known PG sites to date, required special attention to Google Analytics in order to properly trigger pageviews. Google Analytics Pageviews from the August 2024 launch through March 2025 are null. The build includes specialized JavaScript to manually ensure pageview event. 
- Some web traffic information is recoverable from the WP Engine dashboard 
- Google Maps on Locations page connected to a non-PG Google account; unclear if this is client's Google account or a prior developer's. Map views as of December 2025 are well below the threshold that would trigger payment. 

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- The legacy EnviroServe site automatically generated coordinates for new locations upon entering into the page editor. The redesigned site as of 2024 requires manual entry of location coordinates, which can be readily pulled from Google Maps. 
- Client uses a third-party service LocalIQ to improve engagement.

- Github git@github.com:PepperGroup/kensing.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Uses Essential Grid to power News and Events page https://kensingsolutions.com/about/news-and-events/ 
- Uses Ultimate Member to manage Customer Portal registrations and access to proprietary content
- Significant mainland China userbase prevents use of Google reCAPTCHA to secure forms; MT Captcha used instead and connected to Ultimate Member via custom plugin 

**Recurring Tasks**
- Site receives monthly maintenance from PG, including a screenshot of login activity from the MT Captcha dashboard. Most months see around 270-300 successful logins and 15-20 unsuccessful logins. Significantly more or less activity could be a sign of an emergent issue with site traffic and/or security. 

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Client has a significant user base in mainland China, where Google reCAPTCHA does not work. MT Captcha added in November 2024 to secure Member Portal content WordPress back end, and hacked onto the Ultimate Member plugin with a combination of the  **Theme My Login** plugin (secures admin and customer login forms) and a fork from the **MT Captcha** plugin (secures the Ultimate Member registration form). Periodic manual review of custom code involved is strongly advised. 
- Thank You page is included in `sitemap.xml`; adjust settings in Yoast to hide from search and avoid polluting conversion analytics data with inadvertant bot or user traffic 
- Navigation font is incorrect on portal pages (Barlow Condensed instead of correct Montserrat)<br>

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- As of late 2025, Ultimate Member seems to no longer allow email addresses using `+` for uniqueness. Adjusting or updating the websites+subscriber@peppergroup.com Subscriber account used for testing can still be done with use of command line mySql access.

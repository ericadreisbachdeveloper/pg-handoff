- Development git@git.wpengine.com:acelpahealth.git
- Github git@github.com:PepperGroup/acelpa.git

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Site forms built with HubSpot 
- Site uses the Web Accessibility by accessiBe plugin to power the front end accessiBe widget 
- Locations page uses Storepoint map that uses websites@peppergroup.com for login to Client's Google Account for payment; credentials in Keeper 

**Recurring Tasks**
- Monthly Storepoint receipts comes to websites@peppergroup.com for charges related to the Locations page (map feature) https://acelpahealth.com/locations/  Receipts should be forwarded to lynn@peppergroup.com and cc'ed to eliza@peppergroup.com with the note: 
> See attached for Acelpa, job CSP-5118 (Acelpa/CSPRx)

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Optional-but-recommended schema fields missing from blog posts: <br>
<img src="./img/acelpa-posts.png">

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- Footer Privacy Policy links are outbound links to PDFs hosted on HubSpot
- Acelpa is part of a wider pharmacy acquisition network, similar to PG's private equity clients. The acelpahealth.com site was an exception for this client, in that PG created a site from the ground up rather than integrated brand style into an acquisition website (cf https://hisprx.com).

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- A <u>wide</u> range of forms are used on the site: 
    - FormStack script embed <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/ (footer) 
    - FormStack iframe embeds <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/brand-partners/
    - Outbound links to FormStack forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/give-books/ "Start a Book Drive" > https://formstack.io/547E9 
    - Classy/GoFundMe donation embeds <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/donate/ 
    - Outbound links to Classy/GoFundMe pages <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/honorary-memorial-gifts/ "Digital Book Drive Fundraiser" > https://give.berniesbookbank.org/campaign/create-a-fundraising-page/c631618 
    - Embedded Cervis signup forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/individual-volunteering/ 
    - Outbound links to Cervis signup forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/volunteer/ "Volunteer as a Group" > https://berniesbookbank.cervistech.com/acts/console.php?console_id=0042&console_type=group 
    - Outbound links to Microsoft forms <br>e.g. https://www.berniesbookbank.org/give-books/ "Need a Receipt" > https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Z7ESCVhNqUqo1KN5wRzJr-yxVFZeQNFMkKGbvWFJc4pUN1hXRkFYNjRSSDRaSkRURkhYSk1VQVFWUS4u 
- Resulting action upon successful form submission varies widely; some forms redirect to https://www.berniesbookbank.org/thank-you, some forms open in a modal window that then closes, some forms display a modal thank you message, &c. 
- Build includes custom formatting buttons for the WordPress text editor (see `./assets/jas/tiny-mce.js`). Custom formatting buttons: 
    - Screen Reader Only Text
    - highlight (thin font used in header)
    - cite (for Testimonials speaker attribution) 
    - heading (`<h1>` styling as defined in this build)
    - subhead (`<h2>` styling as defined in this build)
    - subsubhead (`<h3>` styling as defined in this build)
    - button (style a link to look like a button)
- Uses a Storepoint embedded map linked to client's Google Account 
- Uses an &ldquo;Opt Out&rdquo; cookie notice powered by CookieYes
- Rotating image in desktop pre-footer section powered by a custom-built module using Advanced Custom Fields Pre-Footer Images repeater field and `/inc/random-images.php`

**Recurring Tasks**
- Ongoing monthly site maintenance

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- FormStack iframe embeds include hard-coded max-height; if client adds or removes fields from within their FormStack interface, the form's max-height should be adjusted within the **Code** block 

![iframe with max-height](./img/bernies-hardcoded-maxheight.png)
- Client's Formstack default settings include placeholder spaces in the Firstname and Lastname fields, which then become bad data in client's CRM; for ease and speed of development, form fields are cleared with JavaScript after the form loads, cf `./assets/jas/clear-formstack-names.js` 
- Internal anchor links to FAQ sections were prone to "not scroll to anchor." As a workaround, monstrous JavaScript in the theme waits for page load and ensures subsequent smooth scroll to FAQ sections: `./assets/forced-anchors.js` 
- Site build uses Schema markup in template files to optimize search surfacing Events and Blog Posts
- Events requries manual updates in ACF for display (cf 
- Schema for Events included only on Chapter pages, as launch date was prioritized over adding development to accommodate the complexity of events with multiple locations and dates 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/chicagoland/ 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/greater-milwaukee/ 
    - https://www.berniesbookbank.org/florida-suncoast/ 
- Events schema logic should be updated to not appear if critical fields are not available (e.g. `location`, `startDate`) 
- Events schema implementation does not include optional-but-recommended fields: 

![Bernie's Book Lovers' Lunch schema results](./img/bernies-schema.png) 

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- Forms are under client control; during development, 
- Site is on `www` subdomain; in the first months after development some users (including client) came to an error page when trying to access the site on the bare domain. In December 2025 client IT added a redirect in client DNS settings which resolved the observed DNS issue. 



## <a id="carow"></a>Carow Packaging 
<img src="./img/carow-home.png" style="margin-bottom: 1.414rem;">

**URL:** https://carowpackaging.com/

**Development URL:** https://carowpackagstg.wpenginepowered.com/

**Tech Stack Notes** 
- Uses Essential Grid for blog posts and products 
- Uses Google reCAPTCHA v3 to secure the site at large
- Forms built with Gravity Forms

**Recurring Tasks**
- Site receives monthly maintenance from PG

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Product sorting is unfortunately limited to a blanket AND or OR Boolean logic, which makes for confusing UI. Essential 
- At some browser heights, top frame cuts off Google reCAPTCHA badge in the lower right corner; screenshot below from Chrome on a retina Mac, 1692 pixels high: 

![Google reCAPTCHA badge cut off on some desktop viewports](./img/carow-recaptcha-badge-cut-off.png)

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- This particular Enfold child build seems particularly vulnerable to not generating CSS on-the-fly; frequently after monthly updates, homepage content does not wrap properly on desktop. CSS consistently properly regenerates upon saving the homepage from the Page Edit screen.

- Site has a standalone Envoy portal airgapped from the WordPress build, used for sensitive individual patient and provider logins https://portal.csprx.com/login/

**Tech Stack Notes**

**Recurring Tasks**
- Receives monthly site maintenace. 

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- This site, alone among known PG sites to date, required special attention to Google Analytics in order to properly trigger pageviews. Google Analytics Pageviews from the August 2024 launch through ____ are lost. Specialty JavaScript to manually ensure pageview event is triggered included in _____. 
- Google Maps on Locations page connected to a non-PG Google account; unclear if this is client's Google account or a prior developer's. Map views as of December 2025 are well below the threshold that would trigger payment. 

**Quirks + Important Context** 
- The legacy EnviroServe automatically generated coordinates for new locations upon entering into the page editor. The redesigned site as of 2024 requires manual entry of location coordinates, which can be readily pulled from Google Maps. 
- Client uses a third-party service LocalIQ to improve engagement. LocalIQ's widget is added in _____.

**Recurring Tasks**
- Site receives monthly maintenance from PG, including a screenshot of login activity from the MT Captcha dashboard. Most months see around 270-300 successful logins and 15-20 unsuccessful logins. Significantly more or less activity could be a sign of an emergent issue with site traffic and/or security. 

**Known Issues / Tech Debt**
- Client has a significant user base in mainland China, where Google reCAPTCHA does not work. MT Captcha added in November 2024 to secure Member Portal content WordPress back end, and hacked onto the Ultimate Member plugin with a combination of the  **Theme My Login** plugin (secures admin and customer login forms) and a fork from the **MT Captcha** plugin (secures the Ultimate Member registration form). Periodic manual review of custom code involved is strongly advised. 
- Thank You page included in `sitemap.xml`; adjust settings in Yoast to hide from search and avoid polluting analytics data
